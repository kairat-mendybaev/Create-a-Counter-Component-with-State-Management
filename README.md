Component Details

Counter.js: Implements a counter with four buttons, each demonstrating a different aspect of state management in React. The component uses the useState hook to keep track of the count and provides various methods to manipulate this state.

Testing and Experimentation

Increment the counter using each button and observe how React handles state updates.
Note the differences between the "Increment Twice" and "Correct Increment Twice" buttons to understand how state batching works and why it's important to use a state updater function when new state values depend on the previous state.
